        - Avoid generic or vague titles such as "Something's not working" or "A couple of problems" — be as descriptive as possible.
        - Keep your issue focused on one single problem. If you have multiple feature requests, please create a separate issue for each of them.
        - Issues should represent **complete and actionable** work items. If you are unsure about something or have a question, please start a [discussion](https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete/discussions/new/choose) instead.
        - Remember that **FsAutocomplete** is an open-source project funded by the community contributions and free time.
